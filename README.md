# simple-tic-tac
Simple TicTacToe game written in Python.
It may not be that interesting for you, but it works.

I made this stuff about two years ago. So don't mind my bad code.

There is an .exe version of this program that you can run on your
Windows OS without Python.

Note: This game is not in English.
